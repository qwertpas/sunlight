## TO DO:

- [x] Add a slider to the web page
- [x] Read values from the slider on the monitor
- [x] Add a slider that can control the LED intensity
- [x] Add individual control sliders for the two LEDs
- [] Make the sliders more continuous (update in real time as you are moving the slider)
- [] Combine both the sliders into one (one end of the spectrum is pure orange and the other is pure blue)
- [] Add a light intensity slider
- [] Make the color temp slider based on the time of the day
- [] Add the feature to change password and name for the network 


## Notes:

- Make the slider more continuous (the light should change value as you're sliding it, instead of only reading the last value)
- The slider value is local. If someone else if changing the slider value on the network, it won't update on my phone (needs to be bidirectional)
- We have chosen an arbitrary number ("544") to be the max value of the slider. It is hardcoded currently, but can be changed after
